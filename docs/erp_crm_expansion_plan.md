# ERPNext & CRM Full Functionality Expansion Plan

## 1. Objectives
- Deliver an end-to-end ERPNext deployment covering Finance, Accounting, HR, Payroll, Manufacturing, Projects, Helpdesk, Quality, Asset Management, and Supply Chain.
- Extend CRM capabilities with omnichannel lead acquisition, opportunity management, CPQ (configure-price-quote), and customer success workflows.
- Integrate Verifactu electronic invoicing to comply with Spanish SII and ticketBAI regulations.
- Orchestrate integrations via n8n and external sandbox APIs to validate flows before production.
- Provide a phased execution roadmap, governance model, and testing strategy to ensure readiness for go-live.

## 2. Current Repository Assets (Baseline)
- **Docker stack** launching ERPNext, databases, and n8n orchestrator.
- **Automation scripts** that bootstrap multi-company configuration, permission matrices, and full ERP/CRM demo data (`scripts/setup_erp_crm.py`).
- **Documentation set** describing organization structure, domain-specific workflows, and success metrics.

## 3. Functional Coverage Matrix
| Domain | ERPNext Module | Key Features | Required Enhancements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Finance & Accounting | Accounts, Accounting Dimensions | Multi-company consolidation, intercompany elimination | Automate multi-currency revaluation, IFRS reporting templates, Verifactu XML generation |
| Sales & CRM | CRM, Selling | Lead/opportunity pipelines, quotations | Omnichannel lead capture, CPQ rules, WhatsApp & Teams chat integrations |
| Purchasing & Procurement | Buying | Supplier onboarding, purchase orders | Vendor scorecards, automated RFQ cycles, SII compliance |
| Inventory & Logistics | Stock | Warehouse transfers, batch/serial tracking | Cold chain monitoring, 3PL integration, IoT sensor ingestion |
| Manufacturing | Manufacturing, Quality | BOM, Work Orders, Quality Inspections | Advanced planning & scheduling (APS), corrective action workflows |
| Projects & Services | Projects, Timesheets | Milestone tracking, billing | AI-driven effort estimation, SLA monitoring |
| HR & Payroll | HR, Payroll | Employee lifecycle, payroll cycles | M365 HR onboarding, Spanish payroll tables, biometric attendance |
| Customer Success & Support | Helpdesk, Issue | Ticket routing, knowledge base | Omnichannel support, CSAT surveys, proactive alerts |

## 4. Verifactu Integration Strategy
1. **Regulatory Scope**
   - Support FacturaE 3.2.2 XML and Verifactu digital signatures.
   - Synchronize with Agencia Tributaria real-time submission endpoints.
2. **Technical Components**
   - Custom ERPNext Doctype `Verifactu Settings` storing certificates and API credentials.
   - Python service within ERPNext app to generate signed XML using `cryptography` and `lxml` libraries.
   - n8n workflow to retry failed submissions and log acknowledgements.
3. **Sandbox APIs**
   - Utilize Agencia Tributaria staging endpoints.
   - Mocked certificate authority via [Verifactu Sandbox](https://www.verifactu.com/sandbox) or request credentials from the client.
4. **Data Flow**
   - Sales Invoice submit → Queue job → XML build → Signature → API POST → Store response & QR code → Attach to invoice.

## 5. External Integrations & Sandbox APIs
- **Banking**: Use PSD2 sandbox providers (BBVA, CaixaBank) for account aggregation and reconciliation testing.
- **Payments**: Stripe test environment for subscription invoices in Galaxy Software.
- **Messaging**: Twilio WhatsApp sandbox and Microsoft Teams webhooks for CRM omnichannel.
- **IoT & Logistics**: Sigfox/TTN sandbox feeds for temperature sensors in Galaxy Bio cold chain.
- **Identity**: Azure AD developer tenant for SSO and role provisioning.

## 6. Execution Roadmap
1. **Discovery (2 weeks)**
   - Process mapping workshops per domain.
   - Data migration assessment and cleansing plan.
2. **Foundation Sprint (3 weeks)**
   - Harden Docker infrastructure, configure backups, set up staging environment.
   - Implement core master data (Chart of Accounts, Item master, BOMs).
3. **Functional Sprints (6 weeks)**
   - Sprint 1: Finance + Verifactu MVP.
   - Sprint 2: CRM + CPQ + omnichannel messaging.
   - Sprint 3: Manufacturing + Quality + IoT monitoring.
   - Sprint 4: HR/Payroll + Projects integration.
4. **Integration & Automation (2 weeks)**
   - Build n8n flows for banking reconciliation, Teams alerts, and Twilio notifications.
   - Validate sandbox API interactions.
5. **Testing & UAT (2 weeks)**
   - Functional, regression, and performance testing.
   - Verifactu certification tests and contingency scenarios.
6. **Go-Live & Hypercare (2 weeks)**
   - Cutover rehearsal, production deployment, 24/7 support window.

## 7. Data Migration Strategy
- Extract historical data from legacy systems into staging tables using Python ETL scripts.
- Normalize data to ERPNext templates (Customers, Suppliers, Items, Employees, General Ledger).
- Leverage ERPNext Data Import Tool with validation scripts.
- Perform trial migrations in staging, reconcile via reports, and document sign-off.

## 8. Security & Compliance
- Enforce Azure AD SSO with SCIM provisioning for user lifecycle.
- Apply row-level security in ERPNext using roles per domain.
- Enable audit trail logs and immutable backups stored in Azure Blob with retention policies.
- Implement GDPR-compliant data retention and right-to-be-forgotten workflows.

## 9. Testing & QA Framework
- Unit tests for custom ERPNext app (Python/JS) using `pytest` and Frappe's test runner.
- Integration tests for Verifactu using mocked responses and sandbox endpoints.
- Automated UAT checklists stored in docs/validation_checklist.md.
- Load testing using `locust` against high-volume modules (Sales Orders, Helpdesk tickets).

## 10. Deployment & Operations
- Utilize GitOps (e.g., FluxCD/ArgoCD) for staging/production parity.
- Implement blue/green releases for ERPNext containers.
- Monitor with Prometheus + Grafana dashboards for system health.
- Define RTO < 2 hours and RPO < 15 minutes with continuous backups.

## 11. Next Steps
- Confirm availability of Verifactu sandbox credentials or request from Agencia Tributaria.
- Prioritize module backlog with stakeholders and assign product owners.
- Execute `python3 scripts/setup_erp_crm.py --site galaxy.local --verifactu-api-key <key>` to populate CRM pipelines, manufacturing templates, and Verifactu webhook configuration.
- Schedule weekly steering committee reviews to track readiness KPIs.
